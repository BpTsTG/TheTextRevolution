TheTextRevolution
=================

The text processing of 21 century.

I begin this project because there is today no
free alternative to Google Docs.

This programme produce HTML5 CSS3 documents

the document is composed of :
- html block called container
Ex: <div class="container">content</div>

a list of style to apply to container
(identified by class)


the output is an html file like that : 
<div class="container">
<div class="container title">The Revolution</div>
<div class="container">
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ...
</div>
</div>

and css:

.title
{
	font-size:30px;
	font-weight:bold;
}

The principe is to use the powerfull of web browser
to render documents and optionnaly use documents
in website.
